  description: '<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Cache Simulator: Simulated a simple Cache which supported actions such as hit/miss/evite while reading and writing data, and applied least recently used policy (LRU)</li><li>Unix Shell: Designed and implemented a tiny Unix shell, fully capable of forking and handling multiple child
processes simultaneously, which also supported background & foreground job control, basic Unix commands</li><li>Dynamic Memory Allocator: Implemented a general purpose dynamic allocator with segregated free lists with
optimal bucket size selection and first-fit search, and greatly improved throughput and memory utilization</li><li>Http Proxy: Developed a concurrent caching Web Proxy, which can be used to access real websites</li></ul>'
