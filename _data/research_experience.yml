  duration: Dec 2016 &mdash; May 2017
  summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"></li>Developed an algorithm for Large Scale Image and Text Cross-modal Retrieval<li><li>Built images dataset with extracted image features stored as data matrices</li><li>Established label matrices and label-property matrices according to image categorization information</li><li>Adopted soft constraint function (SCH) and preamble hashing code to approach target binary code</li><li>Utilized sparse coding to capture the significant structure of images in SCH to increase retrieval accuracy</li></li>Enabled retrieval of images by key words in and out of the database and retrival of topics by an arbitrary image.<li></ul>
